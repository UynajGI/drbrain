# DrBrain — Academic Knowledge Graph System

Vector-free, symbol-driven research discovery engine. Ingest PDFs, build a knowledge graph,
and discover research hypotheses, causal chains, and knowledge frontier signals.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync
uv run drbrain check               # verify environment
uv run drbrain ingest               # ingest PDFs from data/spool/inbox/
uv run drbrain query "graph neural networks"
uv run drbrain analyze <id> --full  # knowledge frontier analysis
uv run drbrain serve                # launch Streamlit UI
```

## Architecture

- **Parser**: MinerU CLI → PyMuPDF fallback, PDF → Markdown
- **Extractor**: 5-stage LLM pipeline (ontology→entities→relations→coreference→refine), 10-way concurrent
- **Dedup**: DOI → arXiv → S2 → OpenAlex → title+year fuzzy match
- **Graph**: NetworkX in-memory + SQLite, rule-based closure with 8+4 inference rules, directed BFS traversal with relation filtering, shortest-path queries
- **Reasoning**: Causal chains, counterfactual analysis, isomorphism detection, hypothesis generation
- **Skills**: 5 AgentSkills.io-compatible skills in `skills/`
